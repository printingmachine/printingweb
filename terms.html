      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions, along with our Privacy Policy and other stated terms, constitute a binding agreement between you and HyNa Technologies. By using our website or kiosks, you agree to these Terms in full. We may update these Terms from time to time, and it is your responsibility to stay informed of changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        You agree to provide true and accurate information while accessing our services. We are not liable for any inaccuracies in the content or materials on our website. Use of our services is entirely at your own discretion and risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any unauthorized use of our kiosks or website may result in legal action. You are expected to use our platform lawfully and not violate any applicable Indian or local laws. You acknowledge that transactions you initiate form a legally binding agreement with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refunds are applicable only if we fail to deliver the service, and claims must be raised within the timeline stated in our policies. We are not responsible for delays or failures caused by factors beyond our control (force majeure).
      </p>

      <p>
        Disputes arising from these terms will be subject to the jurisdiction of courts in Kottangal, Kerala, India.

      <h2 class="gradient-text">Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        At HyNa Technologies, we aim to provide a smooth and reliable self-printing experience through our kiosks. However, please note that once a transaction is completed—i.e., payment is successful and the print has started—we do not offer refunds under any circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        This includes issues such as uploading the wrong file, selecting incorrect print settings, duplicate payments, or dissatisfaction due to formatting problems. Users are solely responsible for the documents they upload.
      </p>

      <p>
        In rare cases where a transaction is successful but the print does not occur, users can reach out to us with proof including transaction ID and kiosk details. If found valid, we may issue reprint credits, not refunds, at our sole discretion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="address-bar-premium">
      <h2 class="gradient-text">Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>
        All kiosk sales revenue is credited monthly to the registered franchisee's bank account. HyNa Technologies is not responsible for any delay caused by payment gateways or banks. Franchise partners are expected to maintain compliance with local financial laws and KYC norms.

      <p>
        We collect uploaded documents (stored temporarily), usage and session data (machine ID, page selections, status), and personal info only if voluntarily submitted. Location data is used to find nearby kiosks.
      </p>

      <h4>3. How We Use Your Data</h4>

        Uploaded files are auto-deleted within 10–15 minutes after print or session timeout. Session logs may be stored up to 30 days for diagnostics. Personal data is retained only as required.
      </p>

      <h4>5. Data Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        We do not sell your data. It is only shared when legally required or to process payments securely using providers like Razorpay.
      </p>

      <h4>6. Security Measures</h4>

        We use industry-standard SSL encryption, secure file access controls, and automated file purging to protect user data.
